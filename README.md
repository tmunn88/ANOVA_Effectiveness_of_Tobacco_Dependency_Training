# Implementation of Repeated Measures ANOVA Model:
## Examining The Effectiveness of Training Nurses to Treat Tobacco Dependency

Note: Since access to this data is privelaged, the R code is not provided but visuals and results can be found in the executive summary and poster.

## Intro to Study and Data
Due to previous collaboration, Dr. Christine Sheffer has given me permission to use a deidentified version of her studyâ€™s dataset, which will be described below. This study was funded by a Medical Education Grant from Pfizer, Inc. awarded to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.

A one-hour training for healthcare professionals (including students) consisting of an evidencebased treatment for tobacco dependency was conducted in-person or online with N=2120
participants. An assessment was given immediately prior to training (pre), immediately after training (post), and at the 6-month mark after training (follow-up).
In addition to the assessment, a great deal of demographic data for each participant was collected prior to training. Demographic data will be detailed later.

## Results
Results indicate a significant main effect of condition (pre vs post vs 6 mo.), p=1.16 e-159.
With the sphericity correction, we obtain a smaller p-value (p=6.66 e-50) for our condition effect (but it is still significant). Further, each pairwise effect was statistically significant. What is more theoretically important is that at the 6 mo. time period participants scores were still significantly greater than the pre-test scores, p=1.5 e-14.
